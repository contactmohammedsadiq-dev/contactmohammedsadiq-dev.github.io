                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>
                    Al-Hidayah Madrasa was established with the vision of providing quality Islamic education 
                    to the Muslim community. What began as a small weekend school has grown into a comprehensive 
                    educational institution serving students of all ages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years, we have remained committed to our founding principles: authentic Islamic 
                    teaching, excellence in education, and nurturing each student's unique potential. Alhamdulillah, 
                    we have witnessed the success of hundreds of students who have memorized the Quran, deepened 
                    their Islamic knowledge, and gone on to serve their communities with distinction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, Al-Hidayah continues to evolve, incorporating modern teaching methodologies while 
                    staying true to traditional Islamic scholarship, ensuring our students receive the best of 
                    both worlds.
