## 📚 SPL Cheat Sheet

### Basic Syntax

```
search_filter | command | command
```

### Common Commands

| Command | Usage | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **fields** | Select columns | `fields time, user, action` |
| **where** | Filter results | `where status=critical` |
| **stats** | Aggregate | `stats count by user` |
| **top** | Top N values | `top 10 source` |
| **dedup** | Remove duplicates | `dedup user` |

### Quick Filters

- `status=critical` → Critical only
- `status=high OR status=critical` → High/Critical
- `time >= -24h` → Last 24 hours
- `user=admin` → Specific user
- `source=192.168.*` → IP range
