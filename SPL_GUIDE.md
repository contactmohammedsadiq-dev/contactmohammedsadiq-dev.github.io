## 🚀 How to Use SPL Queries

### Basic Query Structure

```spl
<source_filter> | <transformation> | <analysis> | <output>
```

**Components:**
1. **Source Filter** - Find events matching conditions
2. **Pipe (|)** - Pass results to next command
3. **Transformations** - Modify, clean, or enrich data
4. **Analysis** - Aggregate and calculate
5. **Output** - Display results

### Example Queries

#### 1. **Find Critical Events by User**
```spl
source=* status=critical | stats count by user
```
- Shows how many critical events each user has
- Useful for user behavior analysis

#### 2. **Track Failed Logins Over Time**
```spl
action=failed_login | timechart count by source
```
- Displays failed login attempts over time
- Helps identify attack patterns

#### 3. **Identify Data Exfiltration Attempts**
```spl
action=data_exfil_attempt | dedup user | fields user, time, source
```
- Lists unique users attempting data exfiltration
- Removes duplicates to focus on unique offenders

#### 4. **High-Severity Event Summary**
```spl
status=high OR status=critical | stats count, avg(time) by action
```
- Analyzes high-severity events by action type
- Shows frequency and timing patterns

#### 5. **Top 10 Source IPs**
```spl
user=* action=* | top 10 source
```
- Identifies most active/problematic source IPs
- Useful for threat intelligence

## ⚡ Quick Filters Explained

### Critical Only
```spl
status=critical
```
- Shows **ONLY critical severity events**
- Narrows focus to highest-priority threats
- **Best for:** Emergency response

### Errors & Alerts
```spl
status=high OR status=critical
```
- Shows **high AND critical severity events**
- Filters out low/medium alerts
- **Best for:** Daily threat hunting

### Last 24h
```spl
time >= -24h
```
- Limits to **events in the last 24 hours**
- Combines with other filters
- **Best for:** Recent incident investigation

### How Filters Work

Filters **add to your query**:
```
[your query] AND [filter]
```

Example:
- Your query: `action=failed_login`
- Click "Last 24h"
- Result: `action=failed_login AND time >= -24h`

## ✅ Query Validation

### Valid Queries Show Green:
- ✓ `source=192.168.1.*`
- ✓ `status=critical | stats count by user`
- ✓ `action=* | top 10 source`

### Invalid Queries Show Red Error:
- ✗ `random text here`
- ✗ `gibberish | foo bar`
- ✗ Invalid field names

**Pro Tip:** Copy from SPL Commands Reference to ensure syntax!

- **< 1 second** = Fast and responsive
- **1-2 seconds** = Normal for large datasets
- **> 2 seconds** = Consider filtering more

### Result Count
- Number of events matching your query
- **Higher = Broader search**
- **Lower = More targeted search**

## 💡 Pro Tips & Tricks

### Tip 1: Build Queries Incrementally
```spl
# Start simple
status=critical

# Add a filter
status=critical AND user=*

# Add analysis
status=critical AND user=* | stats count by user
```

### Tip 2: Use SPL Commands Reference
- Hover over command items to see options
- Green command name = ready to copy
- Read description before using

### Tip 3: Combine Filters
```spl
# Multiple conditions with AND
source=192.168.* AND user=admin AND action=login_success

# OR for alternatives
status=high OR status=critical

# Mix AND + OR (use parentheses to group)
(user=admin OR user=root) AND status=critical
```

### Tip 4: Learn from AI Suggestions
- Study the provided queries
- Understand the pattern: `search | transform | analyze`
- Modify for your needs

### Tip 5: Use Shortcuts
- **Ctrl+Enter** - Execute query (future feature)
- **Clear button** - Reset query field

## 🔧 Customization Guide

### Adding Custom Queries

Edit `SearchExplorer.jsx` to add your own AI suggestions:

```jsx
const aiSuggestions = [
  { 
    query: 'YOUR_SPL_QUERY_HERE', 
    description: 'What this query finds' 
  },
  // Add more...
];
```

### Adding Custom Commands

Add to the `splCommands` object:

```jsx
const splCommands = {
  search: 'Find events matching conditions',
  // Add your command:
  yourcommand: 'What your command does',
};
```

### Changing Filter Behavior

Modify the `applyQuickFilter()` function:

```jsx
case 'custom':
  query = (query ? query + ' AND ' : '') + 'your_filter_here';
  break;
```

## 🚀 Best Practices

### Writing Effective Queries

✅ **DO:**
- Start simple, build complexity
- Use meaningful field names
- Test with small filters first
- Document complex queries
- Use | (pipe) between commands

❌ **DON'T:**
- Forget the pipe | between commands
- Use invalid field names
- Search for too many results at once
- Forget to filter by severity
- Use complex nested expressions without testing

### Investigation Workflow

1. **Define your objective**
   - "Find all failed logins by admin users"
   
2. **Start with a base filter**
   - `action=failed_login AND user=admin`
   
3. **Add analysis**
   - `| stats count, avg(time) by source`
   
4. **Review results**
   - Look for patterns
   
5. **Refine further**
   - Add more filters if needed

## 🔐 Security Analyst Tips

### Threat Hunting Queries

**Finding Suspicious Login Activity:**
```spl
action=failed_login OR action=login_success | stats count by user | where count > 10
```

**Identifying Data Access Anomalies:**
```spl
action=file_access | timechart count by user, source | where count > avg
```

**Detecting Privilege Escalation:**
```spl
action=process_start AND user=admin | dedup source | fields source, time, user
```

### Incident Response Queries

**During Incident:**
```spl
source=192.168.1.* status=critical | fields time, user, action | top 20 user
```

**Post-Incident Analysis:**
```spl
user=attacker_username | stats count by action, source | table action, source, count
```
